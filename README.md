# Basic-Landing-Page
Basic landing page with decent responsive approach

PS:
  
  1. Why not container wrapper instead of repeated max-width ! it's better that way feels more flexible convenient and re-usable !
  
  2. Why you did not style ```<header> <main> <footer>``` elements well i used them for semantic purposes only
  
  if you inspect element in the page (Ctrl + Shift +C) things feel more orginised and beautifully structured
  
  3. i used neseted border-radius in desktop screen âœ¨ 
  
  cons :lack of spacing and lack of better responsive designe
